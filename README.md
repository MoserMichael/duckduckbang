# meta search engine builder

This script builds the html pages for a little meta-search tool;

The html page [in action](https://mosermichael.github.io/duckduckbang/html/main.html) 



# script that builds the page

The [build-cats.py](https://github.com/MoserMichael/duckduckbang/blob/master/build-cats.py) script that generates the search page works as follows: 

1. It load the following url [https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js) this json file contains an entry for each bang! search operator it also includes the classification of each operator in the official [bang page](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).
2. builds the category/subcategory breakup that is used to display the [bang page](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).  
3. format an html page that contains all of the !bang operators into one page (maintain categories displayed in the official bang page)

The tool utilizes [duckduck go bang! operators](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)

# Reason for all this

Lately I have been increasingly using specialised search engines; for example when searching for code it is possible to find a lot in [github search](https://github.com/search/advanced) (the search operators are explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax). 

Now general purpose search engines like google and bing have a hard time to give reasonable answers to each and single search request. That's where specialized search engines come in - they sort of fill in the gaps left by the big players.

# today i learned

The abbreviation of Categories is cat; [here](https://writingexplained.org/english-abbreviations/category)
Are cats capable of categorization? No idea, I like them.
