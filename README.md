# meta search engine builder

This script builds the html pages for a little meta-search tool;

The html page [in action](https://mosermichael.github.io/duckduckbang/html/main.html) 


It load the following url [https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js) and builds the category/subcategory breakup that is used to display the [bang page](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js). It brings together all of of the bang! search operarators on one page. 

The tool utilizes [duckduck go bang! operators](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)

Lately I have been increasingly using specialised search engines; for example when searching for code it is possible to find a lot in [github search](https://github.com/search/advanced) (the search operators are explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax)

# today i learned

The abbreviation of Categories is cat; [here](https://writingexplained.org/english-abbreviations/category)
So are cats capable of categorization?  Really clever animals they are.
